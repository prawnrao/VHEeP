DIS background


1.	eP collisions at sufficently high energies such that after the interaction the proton breaks up into hadrons.

2.	DIS led to the discovery that protons are composite particles containing 3 valance electrons.

3.	High energy eP collisions are dominated by inelastic scattering.

4.	The hadronic final state consists of many particles and as a result can have a range of values ($W^2 = p_4^2 = (p_2 + q)^2$) unlike elastic scattering where the invariant mass of the final state is the mass of the proton.

5.	This additional degree of freedom requires an extra quantity to specify the event kinematics, whereas elastic scattering can be described by the scattering angle alone. The 2 quantities are chosen from Lorentz Invarient quantities W,x,y,\neu and Q^2
