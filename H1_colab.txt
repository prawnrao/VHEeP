HERA and H1 

					----MODERN PARTICLE PHYSCIS BOOK----

1.	HERA was a eP collider that ran from 1997-2007 with a circumfrence of 6.3km. Electrons were accelerated to 27.5 GeV and collided with protons that were accelerated to ~ 900 GeV.

2.	H1 was one of the experiments that was located at HERA and it recorded over 1 million eP DIS collisions with Q^2 > 200 GeV^2.

3.	This allowed for the stucture of the proton to be probed with high precision, at values of Q^2 up to 2 x 10^4 GeV^2 and x below 10^-4.

4.	HERA was able to determine that quarks appear to be point like at scales of uppto Q^2 = 2 x 10^4 GeV^2. If quarks were composite particles then deviations from the Bjorken scaling would be expected when the wavelength of the virtual photon was comparable to the size of the quark.

5.	The data colleced by H1 was consistent with Bjorken scalling and therefore the radius of the quark could be infered to be smaller than 10^-18 m.

6. The 2 main components of the H1 detector are the Liquid Argon calorimeter and the lead-scintillating fibre calorimeter
